# RISC-V-Processor
My implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V ISA in Verilog. This was made for, run on and tested on a Cyclone IV FPGA.
So far it has only the first 37 instructions implemeted. Those are what were deemed necessary to implement the needed basics of a RISC-V
processor. Within the parallel processors folder you can find my Verilog implementation of a parallel system with shared RAM. To implement
this I created my own lock and unlock instructions.
