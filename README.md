# RISC-V-Processor
My implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V processor in Verilog. This was made for, run on and tested on a Cyclone IV FPGA.
So far it has only the first 37 instructions implemeted. Those are what were deemed necessary to implement the needed basics of a RISC-V
processor. Next to be implemented will be fencing for parallel processors running off the same memory.
